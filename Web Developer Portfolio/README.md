## Web Developer Portfolio challenge solution 

For the Web Developer Portfolio challenge solution, flexbox was used instead of a grid structure to create an easy-to-design layout. Flexbox is a powerful layout system that allows for flexible and dynamic layouts, making it ideal for creating responsive designs that can adapt to different screen sizes and device types. With flexbox, it's easy to arrange elements in rows or columns, control their alignment and spacing, and even reorder them on the fly. Overall, using flexbox helped to simplify the design process and create a more intuitive and user-friendly portfolio layout.
